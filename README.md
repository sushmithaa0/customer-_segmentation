  # Insights From Cluster: 
    Cluster 0 : middle age low income low spending
    Cluster 1 : middle age high income high spending
    Cluster 2 : older low income low spending
    Cluster 3 : older high income high spending
  # Campaign Analysis: 
    final campaign performed well than others 2nd campaign showed limitted effectiveness
# CONCLUSION
   In summary, this project successfully identified key customer segments based on demographic and behavioral traits, revealing distinct spending patterns and campaign responses. 
   Insights from the analysis highlighted the significance of the final campaign's performance and the limited effectiveness of the 2nd campaign. Moving forward, these findings can 
   inform targeted marketing strategies to optimize customer engagement and campaign outcomes.
